    "> \"Functions\" are similar to variables; in that they are labels that refer to values. However, with functions, the *values* are *operations* and the operations return *values*. Functions can be defined by users (though do not worry about that yet!), and they are run on variables using parentheses. For example, suppose we have a function `my_function` which operates on the variable we created earlier `weight_kg` and returns a new weight. We can execute the function and assign the returned value to a new variable `new_weight` by doing the following. \n",

    "> # is also valid, and the value returned is essentially discarded.\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The values the function operates on (that we refer to using variables) are known as *arguments*. In `my_function(weight_kg)` `weight_kg` is the argument of the function.\n",
